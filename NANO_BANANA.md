New with Gemini 3 Pro Image

Gemini 3 Pro Image (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) is a state-of-the-art image generation and editing model optimized for professional asset production. Designed to tackle the most challenging workflows through advanced reasoning, it excels at complex, multi-turn creation and modification tasks.

    High-resolution output: Built-in generation capabilities for 1K, 2K, and 4K visuals.
    Advanced text rendering: Capable of generating legible, stylized text for infographics, menus, diagrams, and marketing assets.
    Grounding with Google Search: The model can use Google Search as a tool to verify facts and generate imagery based on real-time data (e.g., current weather maps, stock charts, recent events).
    Thinking mode: The model utilizes a "thinking" process to reason through complex prompts. It generates interim "thought images" (visible in the backend but not charged) to refine the composition before producing the final high-quality output.
    Up to 14 reference images: You can now mix up to 14 reference images to produce the final image.

Use up to 14 reference images

Gemini 3 Pro Preview lets you to mix up to 14 reference images. These 14 images can include the following:

    Up to 6 images of objects with high-fidelity to include in the final image

    Up to 5 images of humans to maintain character consistency


Exemplar:
```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
from PIL import Image

prompt = "An office group photo of these people, they are making funny faces."
aspect_ratio = "5:4" # "1:1","2:3","3:2","3:4","4:3","4:5","5:4","9:16","16:9","21:9"
resolution = "2K" # "1K", "2K", "4K"

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    contents=[
        prompt,
        Image.open('person1.png'),
        Image.open('person2.png'),
        Image.open('person3.png'),

        image_config=types.ImageConfig(
            aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
            image_size=resolution
        ),
    )
)

for part in response.parts:
    if part.text is not None:
        print(part.text)
    elif image:= part.as_image():
        image.save("office.png")
